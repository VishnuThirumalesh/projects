not a level playing field to have democratic run media machines bombarding anyone with that level of hostilities br br we see amp hear amp we read between the lines amp we see that false narrative cnn amp ny times amp other outlets run by democrats who cannot put their own beliefs of donald trump aside amp be impartial amp you have to realise it39s beyond them it is beyond their capabilitiesbr br people who present on cnn for example are intransigent amp outright incompetent or unprofessionalbr br there is anderson cooper or chris cuomo who also like to hear their own voices more than actually stick to the facts br br they have an inability to put their political views aside to be able to do their job impartially amp effectively amp instead create their own narrative with a hostile approach towards donald trumpbr br i saw joe biden constantly interrupt donald trump in this debate amp the media portray it differently from the facts but if donald trump interrupted biden cnn amp it39s presenters with their bias democrat viewpoint will only call out donald trump or create a false narrativebr br it is nothing more than unprofessionalism amp shows the viewer how the propaganda machine works with a bias narrative amp have an attack mentality like a pack of dogs wanting bloodbr br that has been the problem that rich people who have democrat views buy into media amp such like to use as a tool to project their agenda a hrefhttpwwwyoutubecomresultssearch_query23idontbuyitidontbuyita br br donald trump is far better than joe biden any day of the week amp the purge will not get into power or win the election because the people see through joe the purge biden amp his standpoint amp who he is br br he is an elitist person with no commonality with the working manwomen br br also how he can of accumulated his wealth is questionable br br he should also realised those in glass houses shouldn39t throw stones br br watching the debate joe biden was the hostile perpetrator not donald trump who in my opinion is a man who knows he is going to be met with a hostile democrat propaganda machine amp all those around with the same ethos br br i feel donald trump is going to remain in power democrats had their chance for blm in the obama years amp did nothing amp as far as healthcare it is the democrats who deny the poor the opportunity to good healthcare remember they were in power for years before donald trumpbr br for anyone to get the news amp to hear amp see things how they are they have to sift through the false narratives the bias democrat viewpoint or presenter39s amp it is difficult for people to get beyond that but for some it39s easy br br i see what i see amp i hear what i hear amp there is a propaganda machine at work working towards advancing a democrat agenda of lies amp master manipulation by master manipulator39s br br they had their chance amp when the people voted them out they have prevented donald trump from doing his job since he came to power by keeping him wrapped up in everything but his job because they cannot accept defeat br br come november when president trump is reelected they will finally see the people of the united states have woken up to their lies amp propaganda amp won39t put them back in the seat of powerbr br to get the facts people are turning away from the news or media outlets because they just edit what is said br br if you want the facts you don39t read or watch the news br br not anymore br br the reason because the democrat party have shown with their owned media outlets they have bought their way to shutting down the voices of truth amp reason amp push their own agenda across amp people have woken up to it br br joe the purge biden reminds me of someone from the film the purge amp the fact that citizens are walking the streets with automatic weapons or allowed to take over democrat run areas of a cities amp democrat leaders of those cities allowed that to continue amp that shows that joe biden amp his party are willing to allow destruction looting arson amp such likes to go on just to make donald trump look bad that says it allbr br you cannot have people walking the streets with automatic weaponsbr br you cannot have people committing arson vandalism looting robbery or other heinous crimes just walk free br br joe the purge biden is prepared to let the us go up in flames just to get into power br br that is not a person i want at the head of my countrybr br when donald trump states that governors who are democrats said he was doing a good he isn39t lying because i watched the news amp heard amp saw them say it from their own mouth br br democrat governors said exactly that out of their own mouths that donald trump was doing a great job br br the problem with the democrats they39re all so opinionated each one doesn39t know what the others saying amp as a result the head doesn39t know what the tail is doing amp as a result they all continuously contradict each

who are experts in the field of epidemiology by deliberately taking them out of context his hot box joyride during his infectious stage as well as setting a precedent where he blatantly refuses to follow all aspects of cdc protocol from wearing masks to social distancing etc  during his rallies to white house events etc then yes he can be held responsible simply because of the perceived power

diagnosis of having spread the virus to countless others through his selfishness and willful ignorance of scientific evidence he continues to behave in a way that encourages the transmission of the covid19 virusbbbr trump has brought this upon himself and he only has himself to blame due to his own arrogance and hubris it39s not the past lies that is the issue but the fact is in the future everything trump states will be suspect and questioned just like the words of conley his supposed quotdoctorquot there is nothing transparent about that administration the trust has long been

taking them out of context his hot box joyride during his infectious stage as well as setting a precedent where he blatantly refuses to follow all aspects of cdc protocol from wearing masks to social distancing etc  during his rallies to white house events etc then yes he can be held responsible simply because of the perceived power the supporters who follow his example and have of him trump has deliberately flouted science social distancing and made a mockery of masks refusing to wear a mask in situations where it was deemed necessary by hospital authorities and medical consultants we are on our second whitehouse outbreak will this administration ever learnbbbr during the very first covid19 onset trump lied repeatedly to the american people when trump should have leveled about the virus39

could potentially endanger the lives of americans during trunp39s watch over 240000 american citizens are now dead with numbers reaching record numbers due to his weckless inactionbbbr statistics were not on trumps side as he openly encouraged people to attend rallies without social distancing and other protective measures in place he39s now tested positive with the all too real possibility that prior to diagnosis of having spread the virus to countless others through his selfishness and willful ignorance of scientific evidence he continues to behave in a way that encourages the transmission of the covid19 virusbbbr trump has brought this upon himself and he only has himself to blame due to his own arrogance and hubris it39s not the past lies that is the issue but the fact is in the future everything trump states will be suspect and questioned just like the words of conley his supposed quotdoctorquot there is nothing transparent about that administration the trust has long been destroyed and pence helped drive the nail in the coffin of his vice presidential term br when the interim president continues ad nauseam with passiveaggressive misogynistic sentiments ad hominem

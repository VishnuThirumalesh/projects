Digit Recognition using PCA and Dense Neural Network for MNSIT data set


    Load MNIST dataset
    Create PCA function to reduce dimensions
    Visualize the right dimensions to choose for better accuracy
    Build a sequential model for dense neural networks for training
    Test on 3 models with 3 different dimension to choose the best model
